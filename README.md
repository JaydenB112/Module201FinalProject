1. Learning Grid (3-30-23)
CSS Grid's parent is Display: Grid

Grid-Template-Columns: makes columns using the auto element assorts them next to each other automatically.

grid-rows: when the columns you previously made intercept these rows they subsequently create boxes

column-gap: puts space between columns

row-gap: refer to above description just rows

Instead of column and row gap, you can just say gap: _px, _px; for shorthand, the rows and gaps still need to be specified.

NOTE: Instead of auto, you can specify the size specifically of columns and rows to change the way they are assorted.
